10.) from latest update 

use isNan to validate age values (instead of Number(age)) 

    this.age = isNaN(Number(age)) ? 0 : Number(age);


The two versions of Person (function constructor vs. class) are functionally equivalent in terms of behavior, 
    but it's worth noting that using a class is more modern and more widely preferred in ES6+ JavaScript. 
        The function constructor (Person) is somewhat outdated. Using a class makes the code more readable and consistent.




Examples of using splice() to change array values: 

    * remember to use startIndex and deleteCount as arguments (when necessary) - otherwise, defaults are 0? 

1.) Replacing elements: You can replace elements in an array by specifying the startIndex and deleteCount and adding new elements.

2.) Replacing multiple elements:  You can also replace multiple elements by specifying a larger deleteCount.

3.) Removing elements without replacing: just leave new item values blank 

        ex. array.splice(1,2) --> removes 2 items, but there are no values for new items 

4.) Adding new elements: If you want to insert new elements without deleting any, set deleteCount to 0

        *this is a dumb example because you can do the same thing with array.push ?? 



To create the function findMatchingAnimals(beginsWith) that returns a new array containing all animals whose names start with 

    the specified beginsWith string (case-insensitive), we can use the Array.prototype.filter() method in combination 
    
        with the String.prototype.startsWith() method. Weâ€™ll make sure that the comparison is case-insensitive by converting 
        
            both the animal names and beginsWith to lowercase before comparing.




In JavaScript, the switch statement is an efficient way to compare a value against multiple potential options. It works well when you 

	have several possible outcomes based on the same variable, and each outcome involves different code execution. Here's how to 

		use a switch statement effectively:


		*switch statement : one variable --> several outcomes w/ individual code execution
