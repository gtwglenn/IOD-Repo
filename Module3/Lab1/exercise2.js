// concatenates because of the double quotes -- "3 + 4" would equal "7"
console.log( "3" * "4" )
// 12 ?? 
console.log( "3" / "4" )
// 0.75
console.log( "3" - "4")
// ?? 
// I missed this one because I thought it would concatenate to "3-4"
console.log( "3" < "4" )
// true or 1 
console.log( "30" < "4" )
// false or 0 
// I think this is because 'thirty' and 'four' are not stored as a number,
    // let stores them as values; since 'four' is declared before 'thirty', 
    // 'four' is therefore greater than 'thirty' 
// if it was declared as " *num* four = 4 " && " *num* thirty = 30 "
    //THEN the phrase "30" < "4" would be incorrect/false
