<!--    FOR MONDAY 


- use end result of index1.html as example 
    - make more betterer 
        -> why my original function wouldn't work -> notes of that 

- go over dynamically generated content -> using templates and dynamic arrays 

        *I think the directions might be asking you to just make up an array w/ content already included 
            (rather than what I initially thought?)

        *Can how do use Bootstrap? For same idea 

- I understand the concept of templates, but maybe look into other ways they can be used 
        -> learn when/where to use them on future assignments 
            (like I should be doing with loops but I keep forgetting)

- appendChild() refresher 

- add Lab2 folder to Mod4 branch just to see what happens ??? 
    - Module4 branch now appears as 'Module4/Lab1'
