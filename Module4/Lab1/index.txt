You will be building a calculator

List the requirements, in this case you have a total of 4 requirements
    Get data (two numbers)
    Choose an operator
    Get the result
    Reset the screen

Sketch the application - by hand, in Word, Google Docs, PowerPoint, etc

    Include the sketch or a picture of your sketch

Build the application youâ€™ve designed




It would be kind of lame to just do simple text / forms and print result 

html: form -> input for first number 
    --> validate user input --> return if error 

html: form -> select operator (from dropdown list)

html: form -> input for second number 
    --> validate user input --> return if error 

html: print result in separate div ? 
    

** (.js) pressing '=' or submit --> returns result 
    pressing it twice, thrice, etc. --> repeat arithmetic ( operator & second number -> on top of result )

*constant clear calculator button --> return to first step / clears calculator
