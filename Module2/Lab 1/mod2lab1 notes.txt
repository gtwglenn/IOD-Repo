MODULE 2 LAB 1 NOTES 


- learn 2 javascript syntax - especially constants vs/ constructors 

- I thought I could use a checkbox to generate a boolean value but maybe no? sort of yes 

	- checkbox --> typically check the 'checked' property directly 
	
	--> checkbox will only be the value specified (in HTML) when checked 

	***you could turn it into a boolean value if you were a clever robot, like so: 

		const isChecked = marketBox.checked ? 1 : 0;
		console.log(isChecked);  

	

	DONT TRUST CHATGPT AND ITS SILLY LIES
