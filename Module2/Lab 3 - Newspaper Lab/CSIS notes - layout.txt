    - links to another page 

    - visual divide from main page (user, you are now traveling away from 'main page' area)

    - more articles, etc. 


... 

- Eventually have About Us / Contact Info / footer section (darker gradient)



******* WEBPAGE ELEMENTS ALIGNED CENTER ********* 

- more important article/feature --> more space on webpage 

- dropdowns and menus expand so that the user is never taken away from the homepage unless they deliberately click 

- static menu/navigation bar for easy navigation 














---------------- MOVING FORWARD -------------------------



*Navigation bar -- do I want to use 'buttons' or have the text be links with stylized font? 

buttons

*Logo??? 
	lmao 

*Decided on: hoverable dropdowns because slick 


*second/buffer header section should expand out into background of main content area (how do?)

*Maybe I can use pictures of Penny <3 

*wtf margins?
